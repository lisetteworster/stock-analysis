# Stock Analysis with Excel
	The data for these worksheets were relatively easy to execute in the module using VBA after some practice. I feel relatively comfortable using it.
## Overview of Project
	This project had data types, variables, custom buttons, and input for a message box. 
### Purpose
	The purpose of this project was to execute a code to refactor the data to make it run faster.
## Analysis and Challenges
	The analysis had a faster run time the more it was repeated. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Activating the worksheet seemed to be my biggest difficulty. I was confused on when to switch "tabs" and how to make sure the correct one was activated.
## Results

	Refactoring code has its advantages when it comes to enhancement and making sure the code has proper structure. This can make the code easily understandable because code is loosely restructed and duplicate code is eliminated. The disadvantage is that it may introduce bugs in its maintainability in the future of the design code.
	The pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script by changing the ticker to tickerIndex making it easier to select multiple data enteries into the spreadsheet. Code size is reduced.
